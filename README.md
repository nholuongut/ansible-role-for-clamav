Installs ClamAV on RedHat/CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu Linux servers.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    clamav_packages:
      - clamav
      - clamav-base
      - clamav-daemon

(Defaults for Debian/Ubuntu shown). List of packages to be installed for ClamAV operations.

    clamav_daemon_localsocket: /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
    clamav_daemon_config_path: /etc/clamav/clamd.conf

Path configuration for ClamAV daemon. These are hardcoded specifically for each OS family (Debian and Red Hat) and cannot be overidden.

      - regexp: '^.*LocalSocket .*$'
